Due to this the lion's sleep was disturbed and he got up and also got angry. Whereas, as soon as he happened to eat the mouse, the mouse requested him to free him and he swore to him that if he ever needed it, he would definitely come to the lion's help. Seeing this adventure of the mouse, the lion laughed a lot and let him go. One day after a few months, some hunters came to the forest to hunt and caught the lion in their net. At the same time, he also tied him to a tree. In such a situation, the troubled lion tried a lot to free himself but could not do anything. In such a situation, he started roaring loudly. His roar was heard far and wide. The rat was passing through the nearby road and when it heard the lion's roar, it realized that the lion was in trouble. As soon as the rat reached the lion, he immediately started gnawing the trap with his sharp teeth and due to which the lion became free in some time and thanked the rat. Later both went towards the forest together.","Story of the greedy lion. On a hot summer day, a lion in the jungle felt very hungry. That's why he started searching for food here and there. After searching for some time, he found a rabbit, but instead of eating it, he left it because he found it too small. Then after searching for some time he found a deer on the way, he followed it but since he was searching for a lot of food, he was tired, due to which he could not catch the deer. When he didn't get it, he thought back to eating that rabbit. Whereas when he came back to the same place, he did not find any rabbit there because he had left there. Now the lion became very sad and had to starve for many days.","The Story of the Needle Tree. Two brothers used to live near a forest. Out of these two, the elder brother used to behave very badly with the younger brother. As if he used to eat all the food of the younger brother every day and also used to wear new clothes of the younger brother himself. One day the elder brother decided that he would go to the nearby forest and bring some wood, which he would later sell in the market. Will sell for some money.\nAs he went into the forest, he cut down many trees, then while cutting down one tree after another, he stumbled upon a magic tree.\nIn this the tree said, oh kind sir, please don't cut my branches. If you leave me then, I will give you a golden apple. He agreed at that time, but greed awakened in his mind. He threatened the tree that if it did not give him more apples, he would cut off the whole trunk.\nIn such a situation, the magical tree, instead of giving apples to the elder brother, showered hundreds of needles on him. Due to this, the elder brother started crying lying on the ground due to pain.\nNow the day started setting slowly, while the younger brother started getting worried. So he went to the forest in search of his elder brother. He found the elder brother lying in pain near that tree, whose body was pierced with hundreds of needles. He felt pity, he reached his brother, slowly removed every needle with love.\nThe elder brother was watching all these things and he was getting angry with himself. Now the elder brother apologizes to the younger brother for ill-treating him and promises to be better. The tree saw the big brother's change of heart and gave him all the golden apples he would need later."]
